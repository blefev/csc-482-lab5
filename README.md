# csc-482-lab5

This project was compiled with Visual Studio 2019, and compiled with MSVC. I avoided using Microsoft specific features, so it should compile with g++ as well.

## Compiling
Build in Visual Studio, or `g++ main.cpp -o main`

## Running
`./main`

## Testing
Just pass "test" as the first parameter to the binary.

`./main test`

# Plotting
All of the gnuplot scripts are under `gnuplot_scripts`
Simply open or run them with gnuplot. I used the file type `.gp`
Please note, there needs to be data in `output/` for the plotting to work.
